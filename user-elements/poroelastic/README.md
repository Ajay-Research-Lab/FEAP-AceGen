## Folder information

This folder contains the AceGen file for the small-strain poroelastic element. This element was developed as a part of the work presented in the Festschrift on the occasion of the 70th birthday of <a href="https://www.ikm.uni-hannover.de/de/wriggers/" target="_blank">Prof. Peter Wriggers</a>. The element has a Q9/Q4 topology as shown below and utilizes a Taylor-Hood type interpolation for the u/p dependent variables, respectively. More detailed information about the formulation is available in Harish et. al. (2020,2021) [1,2]
