# Elements for coupled problems

This repository is a collection of elements for <a href="http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap/">FEAP</a> to help address coupled problems. The elements, provided here are generated using <a href = "http://symech.fgg.uni-lj.si/">AceGen</a>. AceGen is available as an add-on for Mathematica and facilitates the automatic generation of user elements using an automatic differentiation approach. A detailed 

# Poro-elasticity

### Q9/Q4 Taylor-Hood element
